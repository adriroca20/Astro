        <h2>Hi! I'm Adrian Rocafull.</h2>
        <p> I still remember when that teacher, Roberto,
            showed us how to print our first "Hello world" using C.
            Now, after an <strong>scholar's degree on computer science</strong>, I'm working as a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> 
            and facing amazing challenges daily.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been part of multiple <strong>Hackathons in Valencia</strong>, like IDays and The Challenge VDS2023.
            My enthusiasm for this field leads me to <strong>read programming-related newsletters</strong> and <strong>build projects on my own</strong> in order to keep me up to date.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last but not least, <strong>I love reading</strong>, mostly fantasy books written by authors like Brandon Sanderson or Patrick Rothfuss.
        </p>
